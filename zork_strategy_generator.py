**IMPORTANT - COORDINATE WITH DISCOVERED OBJECTIVES SYSTEM**: 
The agent has a separate real-time objective tracking system that maintains current goals every 20 turns. Your knowledge base should COMPLEMENT this system by focusing on LONG-TERM strategic insights rather than current objectives.

**LEVERAGE PERSISTENT WISDOM**: 
Use the persistent wisdom from previous episodes to inform your analysis. Look for patterns that confirm, contradict, or extend the existing cross-episode knowledge.

Provide insights in these categories focused on strategic patterns and game world knowledge:

1. **Game World Mechanics**: What specific game rules, item behaviors, or location properties were discovered?
2. **Strategic Patterns**: What types of actions consistently lead to progress vs. setbacks across different situations?
3. **Environmental Knowledge**: How do different locations behave? What objects are consistently significant?
4. **Danger Recognition**: What specific threats, traps, or failure patterns should be avoided based on experience?
5. **Efficiency Insights**: What meta-strategies help approach different types of situations more effectively?
6. **Problem-Solving Patterns**: What general approaches work well for different categories of challenges?
7. **Learning from Experience**: What insights about the game world emerged from this gameplay session?
8. **Cross-Episode Validation**: How do these discoveries relate to patterns from previous episodes?

**AVOID (Handled by Objectives System)**:
- Specific current objectives or immediate tactical goals
- Real-time action prioritization advice
- "What should I do next" guidance
- Current situation analysis

Focus on actionable insights that help the agent become better at recognizing opportunities, avoiding dangers, and understanding the game world. Be specific about locations, items, commands, and game mechanics discovered through actual gameplay experience."""

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **NO NEW STRATEGIES**: Only reformat existing content - never invent or add new strategic advice
2. **PRESERVE ALL KEY INFORMATION**: Every important insight, danger warning, item detail, and strategic pattern must be retained
3. **REMOVE REDUNDANCY**: Eliminate repetitive statements and merge similar advice
4. **MAINTAIN STRUCTURE**: Keep the logical organization but make it more compact
5. **AI-FOCUSED LANGUAGE**: Use direct, actionable instructions for an AI language model
6. **CONSOLIDATE EXAMPLES**: Merge similar examples or scenarios into representative cases

**CURRENT KNOWLEDGE BASE TO CONDENSE**:
{verbose_knowledge}

**CONDENSATION GUIDELINES**:
- Merge repetitive advice into single, comprehensive statements
- Combine similar examples or scenarios into representative cases  
- Use bullet points and concise formatting for better readability
- Eliminate verbose explanations while keeping essential details
- Maintain all specific game elements (locations, items, commands, dangers)
- Preserve the strategic frameworks and decision-making patterns
- Keep all unique insights and specialized knowledge

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Provide a condensed version that is 50-70% of the original length while maintaining 100% of the strategic value.

Focus on creating a guide that is information-dense but highly readable for an AI agent during gameplay.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not add any meta-commentary about the knowledge base structure or organization. Do not include sections like "Updated Knowledge Base Structure" or explanations of how the content is organized. Simply provide the condensed content directly."""

- Final score: {final_score}
- Deaths this episode: {death_count}
- Episode ended in death: {episode_ended_in_death}

{death_analysis}

**EXISTING PERSISTENT WISDOM:**
{existing_wisdom if existing_wisdom else "No previous wisdom recorded."}

**SYNTHESIS TASK:**

Extract and synthesize the most critical learnings from this episode that should persist across future episodes. Focus on:

1. **Death Pattern Analysis**: If deaths occurred, what specific patterns, locations, or actions consistently lead to death? What environmental cues signal danger?

2. **Critical Environmental Knowledge**: What persistent facts about the game world were discovered? (Dangerous locations, item behaviors, puzzle mechanics)

3. **Strategic Patterns**: What meta-strategies or approaches proved consistently effective or ineffective across different situations?

4. **Discovery Insights**: What major discoveries about game mechanics, hidden areas, or puzzle solutions should be remembered?

5. **Cross-Episode Learning**: How does this episode's experience relate to patterns from previous episodes?

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Focus on persistent, reusable knowledge rather than episode-specific details
- Emphasize death avoidance and danger recognition patterns
- Maintain existing wisdom while adding new insights
- Remove outdated or contradicted information
- Keep wisdom concise but actionable for an AI agent

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide the updated persistent wisdom as a well-organized markdown document. If no significant new wisdom emerged, return "NO_SIGNIFICANT_WISDOM" instead."""
